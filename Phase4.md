#  Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)

In this phase, various Salesforce automation tools were configured and implemented in the **Corporate Loan Management System (CLMS)**.  
The purpose of these automations is to ensure smooth processing of loan applications, enforce business rules, reduce manual effort, and provide real-time updates to different stakeholders involved in the loan lifecycle.

The tools used include:  
- Validation Rules  
- Workflow Rules  
- Process Builder  
- Approval Process  
- Flow Builder (evaluated)  
- Email Alerts  
- Field Updates  
- Tasks  
- Custom Notifications

## üîπ Validation Rules

Validation Rules were created on the Loan Application object to ensure data accuracy and enforce corporate policies. These rules prevent users from saving invalid data.

- **Loan Amount Validation** ‚Üí Loan Amount must be greater than zero.  
- **Loan Tenure Validation** ‚Üí Tenure must be at least 6 months.  
- **Interest Rate Validation** ‚Üí Interest rate must be between 5% and 30%.  
- **Application Date Validation** ‚Üí Application date cannot be in the future.  

 **Outcome:** Invalid or inconsistent data cannot be saved, which maintains high data integrity.

## üîπ Workflow Rules

Workflow Rules were implemented to automate routine actions triggered on Loan Applications.

- **Workflow 1: Email on Loan Approval**  
  - Trigger: Status = Approved by Branch Manager  
  - Action: Sends automated Loan Approval Email to Loan Officer  

- **Workflow 2: Approval Date Auto-update**  
  - Trigger: Status = Approved by Branch Manager  
  - Action: Updates `Approval_Date__c` with TODAY()  

- **Workflow 3: Task Assignment to Finance Officer**  
  - Trigger: Status = Approved by Branch Manager  
  - Action: Creates a Task ‚ÄúDisburse Loan Amount‚Äù for Finance Officer (due next day)  

 **Outcome:** Loan Officers are notified, approval timelines are recorded, and Finance Officers are reminded to disburse funds.

## üîπ Process Builder

Process Builder was used for advanced automation that required creating related records.

- **Process: Loan Approval Process**  
  - Object: Loan Application  
  - Trigger: Status = Approved by Branch Manager  
  - Action: Create EMI Schedule record with:  
    - Loan Application linked to approved Loan  
    - EMI Amount = Loan Amount √∑ Loan Tenure  
    - Due Date = Today + 30 days  
    - Status = Pending  

 **Outcome:** EMI Schedules are generated automatically upon loan approval.

## üîπ Approval Process

Approval Process was created to define hierarchical loan approval.

- **Step 1: Credit Manager Review** ‚Üí Status = Pending ‚Üí Approver = Credit Manager.  
- **Step 2: Branch Manager Review** ‚Üí Status = Approved by Credit Manager ‚Üí Approver = Branch Manager.  

- **Final Approval Action:** Status updated to Approved by Branch Manager ‚Üí triggers Workflow Rules + EMI creation.  
- **Final Rejection Action:** Status updated to Rejected ‚Üí Loan Officer notified (optional rejection email).  

 **Outcome:** Loans follow a structured, hierarchical approval chain (Loan Officer ‚Üí Credit Manager ‚Üí Branch Manager).

## üîπ Flow Builder (Screen, Record-Triggered, Scheduled, Auto-launched)

Flow Builder was evaluated but not used in this project to avoid redundancy.  
- Workflow Rules and Process Builder were sufficient for the required automations.  
- Flow Builder can be used in future enhancements (guided screens, scheduled updates).  

 **Outcome:** The automation design remains simple but scalable.

## üîπ Email Alerts

Email Alerts notify stakeholders of important loan lifecycle events.

- Loan Approval Email ‚Üí Sent to Loan Officer  
 

 **Outcome:** Ensures transparency and timely communication.

## üîπ Tasks

Tasks were created to assign responsibilities automatically.

- **Finance Officer Task:** When loan is approved, task ‚ÄúDisburse Loan Amount‚Äù is created for Finance Officer with due date = next day.  

 **Outcome:** Ensures disbursal activities are completed on time.

  - Recipient: Loan Application Owner (Loan Officer)  
  - Title: Loan Status Update  
  - Message:  
    ```
    Loan Application [Loan_Application__c].Name has been [Loan_Application__c].Status__c.
    ```

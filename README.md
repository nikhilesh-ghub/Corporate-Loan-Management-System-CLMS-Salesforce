# Corporate-Loan-Management-System-CLMS-Salesforce
The Corporate Loan Management System (CLMS) is a Salesforce-based B2B application designed for banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions to manage corporate loan applications, approvals, EMI schedules, and repayments in real-time.

## Problem Statement
In the financial services industry, managing corporate loans is often complex and inefficient due to fragmented systems, manual approval processes, and limited visibility into loan status and repayments. Banks and NBFCs struggle with:

Delays in processing loan applications due to multi-level approvals
Lack of centralized tracking for loan documents, EMI schedules, and repayments
Difficulty in providing real-time updates to corporate clients
Limited automation in reminders and overdue payment follow-ups
Poor decision-making due to absence of consolidated reports and dashboards
The Corporate Loan Management System (CLMS), built on Salesforce CRM, addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, automated, and scalable B2B solution that streamlines the loan lifecycle from application to closure, improves stakeholder collaboration, and enables data-driven decision-making.

# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## 1. Problem Statement
In the financial services industry, managing **corporate loans** is often complex and inefficient due to fragmented systems, manual approval processes, and limited visibility into loan status and repayments. Banks and NBFCs struggle with:

- Delays in processing **loan applications** due to multi-level approvals  
- Lack of centralized tracking for **loan documents, EMI schedules, and repayments**  
- Difficulty in providing **real-time updates** to corporate clients  
- Limited automation in **reminders and overdue payment follow-ups**  
- Poor decision-making due to absence of **consolidated reports and dashboards**

The **Corporate Loan Management System (CLMS)**, built on Salesforce CRM, addresses these challenges by providing a **centralized, automated, and scalable B2B solution** that streamlines the **loan lifecycle from application to closure**, improves **stakeholder collaboration**, and enables **data-driven decision-making**.

## 3. Stakeholder Analysis
- **Corporate Client (Account/Contact)** → Company applying for the loan and its representatives (CFO, Finance Manager)

## 4. Business Process Mapping
**End-to-End Loan Lifecycle:**
1. Corporate client submits loan request → **Opportunity created** in Salesforce  
2. Loan Officer verifies documents → stored in **Loan_Document__c**  
3. Approval workflow → Loan Officer → Credit Manager → Branch Manager  
4. Upon approval → **Apex Trigger generates EMI_Schedule__c**  
5. Payments recorded in **Payment__c** → updates loan balance  
6. Automated reminders sent for upcoming/overdue EMIs  
7. Loan auto-closes once all EMIs are completed  
8. Management tracks loan performance via **Reports & Dashboards**
